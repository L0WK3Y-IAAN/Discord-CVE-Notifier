## A Python script that periodically checks for new vulnerabilities from the JSON data provided by CISA (Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency). Here's a brief description of what your script does:

### -Fetching Vulnerability Data: It retrieves JSON data containing information about known exploited vulnerabilities from the CISA website using an HTTP request.
### -Parsing and Processing Vulnerability Data: It parses the JSON data and extracts relevant information about each vulnerability, such as CVE ID, severity level, description, vendor/project, product, etc.
### -Scraping NVD for Additional Information: For each vulnerability, it scrapes the National Vulnerability Database (NVD) website to obtain more details, such as the base score, using BeautifulSoup library.
### -Posting Vulnerabilities to Discord: It constructs Discord embeds for each vulnerability, including details like CVE ID, severity level, description, etc., and posts them to a specific Discord channel.
### -Database Management: It keeps track of the vulnerabilities that have been posted to avoid reposting them by storing their CVE IDs in a SQLite database.
### -Scheduled Task Execution: It runs as a Discord bot and periodically checks for new vulnerabilities every day. It uses asyncio to manage asynchronous tasks and runs an infinite loop to execute the vulnerability check at regular intervals.

#### Overall, the script automates the process of monitoring and sharing information about known exploited vulnerabilities with users on Discord, providing them with timely updates to help them stay informed about potential security risks.
